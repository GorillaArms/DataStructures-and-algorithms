# DataStructures-and-algorithms
This is a repository to store work done to learn data structures and algorithms. 


The goal of this repository is simply to store the code I've worked on learning data sturctures and algorithms. 
When possible all data structure implementations should be independant of one another and use templates to support multiple data types.
